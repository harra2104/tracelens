**What is TraceLens?**

TraceLens is an intelligent browser trace diagnostics platform built to help support engineers quickly analyze network, authentication, and rendering issues using browser-generated logs such as NetLog and HAR files. It automates the process of parsing large trace files, identifies failure points, reconstructs the browser connection journey, and presents meaningful technical explanations, evidence, and remediation guidance.

Instead of manually reviewing thousands of log entries, support engineers can use TraceLens to quickly understand:

1. where a failure occurred,
2. what technically caused it,
3. what evidence supports the finding,
4. and what corrective actions can be taken.

**Why was TraceLens created for support environments?**

TraceLens was created to solve a major challenge in support environments: browser diagnostics are complex, time-consuming, and often require deep protocol expertise.

**In enterprise support, customer issues frequently involve:**

- DNS failures,
- TLS handshake issues,
- proxy misconfigurations,
- authentication / SSO loops,
- refresh token failures,
- browser PDF rendering problems.

**Traditionally, support engineers rely on raw traces from tools like:**

edge://net-export
chrome://net-export
browser HAR captures

These logs can contain thousands of events and are difficult to interpret manually. This slows down root cause analysis and increases time-to-resolution.

**TraceLens was built to:**

Reduce troubleshooting time,
Improve consistency in diagnostics,
Provide evidence-backed analysis,
Make complex browser issues easier to explain to customers.

**When is TraceLens useful?**

TraceLens is especially valuable in support scenarios where:

1. **Faster Root Cause Analysis is needed**

Support teams can quickly identify:

DNS lookup failures,
TCP connection issues,
TLS certificate problems,
HTTP request failures,
browser sign-in problems.

**2.Enterprise customer escalations need structured evidence**

TraceLens helps support teams provide:

Technical reasoning,
Trace-backed proof,
Clear remediation steps.

3. **Repeated browser issues impact productivity**

Useful for:

Microsoft 365 access issues,
SaaS login problems,
proxy / VPN connectivity failures,
browser policy-related authentication failures.

4. **Cross-team collaboration is needed**

TraceLens helps:

support engineers,
escalation engineers,
network teams,
identity teams,
work from the same technical evidence.

**Why start with browsers?**

Starting with browsers was a deliberate and practical decision because the browser is now the primary client interface for most enterprise workloads.

**Today, business-critical services rely heavily on browsers, including:**

Microsoft Edge,
Google Chrome,
cloud portals,
SaaS applications,
SSO and identity services,
collaboration platforms.

**Browsers sit at the center of:**

user authentication,
security policies,
network access,
downloads,
document rendering,
conditional access.

**A failure in the browser can directly affect:**

sign-in,
productivity,
customer workflows,
business continuity.

**By starting with browsers, TraceLens addresses:**

high-volume support pain points,
rich diagnostic telemetry already available in Chromium traces,
scenarios with immediate customer impact.

**Long-Term Vision for TraceLens**

TraceLens is designed as the foundation for a broader diagnostics intelligence platform.
**In the future, it can expand beyond browser traces to support:**
application diagnostics,
operating system networking issues,
authentication stacks,
endpoint security troubleshooting,
document / PDF rendering analysis,
cloud access diagnostics.

The long-term value of TraceLens is to make support:
faster,
smarter,
more repeatable,
less dependent on manual log reading and tribal knowledge.
